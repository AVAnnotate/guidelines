# Introduction
AVAnnotate is a tool designed to enhance audiovisual materials with rich, meaningful contexts for educational, archival, and research use. 

These guidelines include 
- [Principles of Engagement](https://avannotate.github.io/guidelines/pages/principles) around using AVAnnotate specifically and for creating contextual material more generally for audiovisual (AV) content outside of the contexts created within collection institutions.

- [Stakeholder Guidelines](https://avannotate.github.io/guidelines/pages/stakeholders) for contributors, collaborators, or creators/co-creators in the development of AVAnnotate projects.
