# Principles of Engagement
 These Principles of Engagement are for using AVAnnotate specifically, but we also hope may be used for creating contextual material more generally for audiovisual (AV) content outside of the contexts created within collection institutions. An AVAnnotate user’s goals might be to create better access to materials or they could be pedagogical or research-focused. These sorts of specific use cases are the genesis of these principles, but our hope is that these principles also serve communities beyond their use of the AVAnnotate platform to consider ethical and effective engagements with AV collections. Our aim is to encourage open dialogue among all stakeholders—researchers, educators, institutions, cultural communities, developers, and the public. They are not prescriptive, but instead offer thoughtful recommendations and pathways to responsible engagement with this and other platforms that help users create context around recordings.
