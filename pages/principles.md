# Principles of Engagement
An AVAnnotate user’s goals might be to create better access to materials or could be pedagogical or research-focused, and these specific use cases are the genesis of these principles, but our hope is that they also serve communities beyond their use of the AVAnnotate platform to consider ethical and effective engagements with AV collections. The aim is to encourage open dialogue among stakeholders—researchers, educators, institutions, cultural communities, developers, and the public. These principles are not prescriptive, but instead offer thoughtful recommendations and pathways to responsible engagement with the platform.
