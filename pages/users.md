# AVAnnotate User Guidelines
Active users are the primary audience for these guidelines. Stakeholders can passively or actively engage with AVAnnotate projects. “Passive” users primarily approach AVAnnotate projects as learning objects and the communication is one-directional. “Active” users are contributors, collaborators, or creators/co-creators (to use Nina Simon’s typology) in the development of AVAnnotate projects.
