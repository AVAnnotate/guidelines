# Researchers
Researchers seeking to use AV materials for professional/non-academic publications such as newspaper articles, films, books, websites should also consider ethical representation of the original material, any legal and copyright restrictions given by the material source, and the use of AVAnnotate in a responsible manner as per traditional research ethical standards. 

## Researching with AVAnnotate
In each of the following intersecting workflows for creating an AVAnnotate project, there are two considerations to keep in mind: 
- How the information is portrayed will influence a particular audience’s understanding of the audiovisual material being made available in an AVAnnotate project.
- How and if recordings have been made accessible online for a public audience influences how the recordings can be made accessible for playback (i.e., upload to the Internet Archive) in an AVAnnotate project.
