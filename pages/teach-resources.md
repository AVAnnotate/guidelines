# Teaching Resources
Teachers across various educational contexts utilize AVAnnotate to more thoroughly engage with class content, promote active learning, and support course learning objectives related to multimodal composition and analysis. The following resources offer inroads for educators across the humanities to implement AVAnnotate, as well as pedagogical materials that can be adapted to fit the learning objectives of varied classroom settings.
