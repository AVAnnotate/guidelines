# Teaching Resources
Teachers across various educational contexts utilize AVAnnotate to more thoroughly engage with class content, promote active learning, and support course learning objectives related to multimodal composition and analysis. The following resources offer inroads for educators across the humanities to implement AVAnnotate, as well as pedagogical materials that can be adapted to fit the learning objectives of varied classroom settings. 

[Teaching with AVAnnotate - Case Studies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kyh5GOH26CGubcBqDr4Cy_Q68cB96OFMv_IZrQ-b0cg/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
  This document provides detailed information on how teachers and students used AVAnnotate across different classroom contexts during the Spring 2025 semester. The case study write-ups include the following resources:
  - Course descriptions
  - Course learning objectives
  - Assignment descriptions and deadlines 
  - Semester calendars (weekly/daily agendas; module and unit breakdown)
  - Lesson plans
  - In-person classroom materials 
  - Annotation peer review guidelines
  - Sample student projects

### Lesson Plans and Activities
[SpokenWeb Pedagogy Collection – 	AVAnnotate](https://jentery.github.io/SWDemo/output_documents/AVAnnotate.html)
  This lesson plan is designed for use in a first-year writing classroom that engages with multimodal texts and literacies. This lesson plan will 1) teach students how to critically analyze and engage audiovisual texts, and 2) offer students a structure for multimodal composing methods via the AVAnnotate software.

This resource describes how to use AV resources at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas in AVAnnotate projects.  

[AVAnnotate Course Templates](https://lor.instructure.com/resources/1950da9aa46d4a3192fddb9de1514dc0){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
  This repository contains three Canvas course templates for integrating AVAnnotate content and assignments into undergraduate and graduate courses.

[Escuchando sobre pueblos indígenas en español](https://lor.instructure.com/resources/8f9522868b4b47929839ed98f36aef55?shared){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
  This repository contains a Canvas module with four lessons (videos and comments) for an introductory Spanish course that integrates AVAnnotate to create interactive lessons that combine linguistic skills with cultural awareness. The lessons focus on themes related to Indigenous peoples of Latin America. 

### Presenting Student Projects
A popular deliverable of incorporating AVAnnotate in the classroom has been class-wide anthologies of student projects. The directions below explain how a class might create a shared anthology, like [the RHE 306 Anthology](https://trentwintermeier.github.io/rhe-306-anthology/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which presents all of the projects students individually created in a First-Year Composition class in the Spring 2025 semester. 

### Instructions for creating a class anthology:
1. Connect via GitHub.
   - The instructor and each student will need to individually create their own GitHub account.
   - The instructor creates a [GitHub Organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for the class.
2. The instructor [adds each student](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.10/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/adding-people-to-your-organization){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} as a member to the class GitHub organization using each student's GitHub username.
    - Note: the instructor can control students' editing permissions by designating a "role" for each student in the GitHub organization. If the instructor wants each       student to have automatic editing access to all other students' project, select `Owner.` In the `Member` role, students will be able to view other student's projects through the AVAnnotate dashboard but will not be able to edit.
3. Each student creates their own project as part of the the class organization when they [Add a Project](https://avannotate.github.io/documentation/pages/creating_projects/).


The AVAnnotate team is always happy to support teachers seeking to teach with AVAnnotate, and offers in-person and virtual walk-throughs for students and instructors; workshopping; and technical support.
