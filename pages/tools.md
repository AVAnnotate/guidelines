# Recommended Complementary Tools with AVAnnotate
[aTrain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11967?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- aTrain is an open-source, offline transcription tool that uses [Whisper](https://openai.com/index/whisper/) plus speaker-recognition capabilities. It has a graphical interface with no programming required and exports transcripts compatible with qualitative data software like [MAXQDA](https://www.maxqda.com/) and [ATLAS.ti](http://ATLAS.ti).
- You could use aTrain with AVAnnotate by first generating accurate, speaker-labeled transcripts of your audiovisual files in aTrain. Then, import those transcripts into AVAnnotate to create searchable, time-aligned annotations and interactive, web-based presentations of the media.

[ELAN](https://archive.mpi.nl/tla/elan)
- ELAN is a free, open-source software tool developed by the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. It allows users to add unlimited, time-aligned textual annotations to audio and video recordings, organizing them into multiple interconnected tiers.
- One could use AVAnnotate alongside ELAN by exporting annotated media from ELAN (e.g., in XML) and then uploading the recordings and corresponding annotations into AVAnnotate. This allows for the publication of interactive, web-accessible editions of the audiovisual material with searchable timestamps and contextual essays.

[oTranscribe](https://otranscribe.com/)
- A free, open-source web app for manual transcription that runs locally in your browser, supports keyboard-controlled playback, interactive timestamps, and exports to Markdown, plain text, and Google Docs.
- Use it with AVAnnotate by exporting your time-stamped transcript (e.g., Markdown/TXT) from oTranscribe and uploading the media plus transcript to AVAnnotate to create a web-published, searchable, time-aligned edition.

[Otter.ai](http://Otter.ai)
- A real-time transcription and “meeting assistant” platform with integrations (e.g., Zoom/Meet/Teams) and export options including TXT, DOCX, PDF, and SRT captions.
- Use it with AVAnnotate by exporting your Otter transcript (ideally SRT for timings) and attaching it with the corresponding media in AVAnnotate to build a public, time-aligned, annotated edition.

[TurboScribe](https://turboscribe.ai/)
- An AI transcription service (Whisper-based) that accepts common audio/video formats, supports speaker recognition and translation, and lets you export transcripts and captions (TXT/DOCX/PDF/SRT/VTT/CSV), including bulk export. 
- Use it with AVAnnotate by exporting SRT/VTT (or TXT) from TurboScribe and pairing those files with your source media in AVAnnotate to publish an interactive, time-coded presentation.

[VOMO.ai](http://VOMO.ai)
- An AI meeting notetaker/transcription tool that records or ingests audio/video, generates transcripts and summaries, and offers sharing/organization features.
- Use it with AVAnnotate by exporting the transcript from VOMO and loading it with your audio/video into AVAnnotate to present searchable annotations alongside contextual materials.
