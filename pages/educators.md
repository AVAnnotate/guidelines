# Educators 
Educators interested in using AVAnnotate may include instructors across disciplines (humanities, sound studies, cultural studies, etc.), especially in course settings that ask students to engage in multimodal composition and analysis of AV objects. Importantly, AVAnnotate is a free, portable, and flexible technology that requires minimal technical expertise and allows for use across fields and experience levels. 
Specific considerations that educators should be aware of include issues of media accessibility (especially regarding institutional permissions and access to AV materials and collections students will engage) as well as how sensitive materials are framed and available for student use.
