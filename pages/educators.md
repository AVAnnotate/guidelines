# Educators 
Educators interested in using AVAnnotate may include instructors across disciplines (humanities, sound studies, cultural studies, etc.), especially in course settings that ask students to engage in multimodal composition and analysis of AV objects. Importantly, AVAnnotate is a free, portable, and flexible technology that requires minimal technical expertise and allows for use across fields and experience levels. 
Specific considerations that educators should be aware of include issues of media accessibility (especially regarding institutional permissions and access to AV materials and collections students will engage) as well as how sensitive materials are framed and available for student use. 

## Guiding Questions
- **How will I use the tool as a lens for examining AV primary sources in my course?**
  Do I primarily want students to interact/explore AV primary sources for analysis using the tool? Do I want them to use the tool to produce and overlay new knowledge/insights on the AV primary source?
- **What do I want students to learn from engaging with audiovisual materials?**
  How will I frame student engagement? Projects that include oral histories, archival film, or YouTube or Twitch videos all require different perspectives on access and sharing. Which perspective will best inform my students’ projects?
- **What do I want students to learn from engaging AVAnnotate technology?**
  How do my class learning objectives map onto or diverge from the affordances of digital annotation? Will my conversations include issues around access and privacy or cultural sensitivities? Will students develop tags or will I create them for them? Will I discuss the significance of annotation as a means for discovery with AV? 
- **Do my students have access to technology that will support their use of digital tools and/or AV artifacts?**
  Do students have web access and/or video/audio players?
- **What technical expertise and/or resources will support students’ engagement with AV artifacts or the AVAnnotate tool? 
  Is workshop support, a technical expert, or bespoke documentation for a particular lesson plan or assignment needed? 
- **How will students be assessed based on projects and learning?**
  Are new rubrics, grading schemas, or evaluation criteria needed to assess students’ digital and/or multimodal projects? 
- **What do I need to teach about transparency and consent regarding potentially harmful content?**
  Maybe the annotations themselves could be useful for providing links or references to outside resources that could be useful for students who need context for a problematic or triggering topic. More generally, just beyond problematic and triggering subject matter, use annotations as routes to broader access to related material that may not be the present focus of a set of annotations, but which the students might consider relevant. “Before you explore this topic: explore this ______ in regard to the topic of sexual violence/more sensitive topics”

## Teaching workflows

![Image 1](../assets/creatingateachproject.png)

In each of the following intersecting workflows for creating an AVAnnotate project, there are two considerations to keep in mind: 
- How the annotations and index terms employed in the AVAnnotate project will help students critically engage with the AV.
- How the assignment is crafted to help students make an argument with AVAnnotate that reflects their understanding of the learning objectives.

## Additional Resources
Teachers across educational contexts use AVAnnotate to more thoroughly engage class content, promote active learning, and support course learning objectives about multimodal composition and analysis. The following resources offer in-roads for educators across the humanities to implement AVAnnotate, as well as pedagogical materials that can be adapted to fit the learning objectives of varied classroom settings. 
- [Teaching with AVAnnotate - Case Studies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kyh5GOH26CGubcBqDr4Cy_Q68cB96OFMv_IZrQ-b0cg/edit?tab=t.8udsh86dhkbh#heading=h.2hxhnokol45w)
  This document includes detailed information about how teachers and students used AVAnnotate in different classroom contexts during the Spring 2025 semester. The case study write-ups include the following resources…  
  - Course descriptions
  - Course learning objectives
  - Assignment descriptions and deadlines 
  - Semester calendars (weekly/daily agendas; module and unit breakdown)
  - Lesson plans
  - In-person classroom materials 
  - Annotation peer review guidelines
  - Sample student projects
- [SpokenWeb Pedagogy Collection – 	AVAnnotate](https://jentery.github.io/SWDemo/output_documents/AVAnnotate.html)
  This lesson plan is designed to be used in a first-year writing classroom that engages multimodal texts and literacies. This lesson plan will 1) teach students how to critically analyze and engage audiovisual texts, and 2) offer students a structure for multimodal composing methods via the AVAnnotate software.
