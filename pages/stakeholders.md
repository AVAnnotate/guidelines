# AVAnnotate Stakeholders
Stakeholders can passively or actively engage with AVAnnotate projects. “Passive” users primarily approach AVAnnotate projects as learning objects and the communication is one-directional. “Active” users are contributors, collaborators, or creators/co-creators (to use Nina Simon’s typology) in the development of AVAnnotate projects. Active users are the primary audience for these guidelines.
