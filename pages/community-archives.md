# Community Archives
Community archives can benefit from using AVAnnotate in a number of ways. A community archive(https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/community-archives.html ){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is a community-led (or community-governed) effort to collect, describe, preserve, and share records that document the experiences, histories, and cultural knowledge of a particular group—especially materials that have been overlooked, misrepresented, or controlled by external institutions.

## How community archives can benefit from using AVAnnotate
•	Layered community context around AV materials: Publish time-stamped annotations, index terms, and project narratives that keep community knowledge attached to recordings rather than separated into external finding aids.

•	Supports plural voices and perspectives: Maintain distinct annotation sets (e.g., community narration, curator notes, researcher commentary, machine-transcript drafts), enabling multiple truths without collapsing them into a single “official” description.

•	Improves discoverability without sacrificing nuance: Indexing and structured annotation make long recordings more navigable while preserving complexity and contextual warnings.

•	Accessibility-forward workflows: Integrate transcripts/captions, alt text, and accessibility checks as a baseline practice to make community materials usable by more people.

•	Interoperable, standards-aware publishing: Benefit from IIIF-oriented, web-based delivery patterns that improve portability and reduce lock-in.

•	Transparent documentation and reproducible practice: AVAnnotate’s emphasis on documenting workflows helps community archives formalize consent, access, and description processes in ways that are legible to participants and partners.

•	Flexible deployment options: Use public sites when appropriate and consider private/offline or alternative-server pathways when sensitivity or safety requires it.

•	A practical pathway to reciprocity: Pair publication with skill-sharing and co-authorship/credit practices, supporting community members as producers of knowledge—not just sources.

## What community archives should consider when using AVAnnotate
### Ownership and control
•	Who owns the recordings and associated metadata/annotations?
•	Who has decision rights over description, publication, revision, and takedown?
###	Consent is ongoing, not one-time
•	Do participants understand how annotation and web publication can change the reach and meaning of a recording?
•	Is there a clear process for withdrawal, redaction, or changing access conditions?
###	Sensitivity, safety, and potential harms
•	Could public access expose participants to harassment, surveillance, or mis-contextualization?
•	Are there cultural protocols for restricted knowledge, sacred content, or community-only circulation?
###	Access model and hosting choices
•	Should the project be public, community-only, or restricted?
•	Does the material require offline/private hosting rather than open GitHub Pages-style publication?
###	Copyright, licenses, and ethical reuse
•	Are rights and reuse terms documented in plain language?
•	Are there fair use assumptions that won’t hold for community priorities or safety needs?
###	Metadata justice and respectful description
•	What language is appropriate, who determines it, and how will contested terms be handled?
•	How will you support community review and correction of the description over time?
###	Sustainability and preservation
•	What is the preservable “package” (media, annotations, metadata, documentation), and where will it live long-term?
•	Who maintains the site, updates dependencies, and retains institutional knowledge if staff/volunteers change?
