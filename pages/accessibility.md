# Accessibility

## Introduction
Accessibility in digital tools like AVAnnotate involves ensuring that all stakeholders can effectively use and benefit from the platform. Accessibility considerations for all tools incorporating AV presentation should include compliance with legal requirements, adoption of universal design principles, and addressing community-specific needs. Central questions on which this section seeks to expand are: 
- What access does the primary audience need (sensory, language, literacy, device)?
- How do you align selection and presentation of content with accessibility goals?
- What are the broader trust and compliance issues between AVAnnotate and partner institutions?

## Definitions and Conceptual Framework
Please consult the guidelines listed in subsequent sections for more specific definitions promulgated by standards bodies. 
- *Accessibility* refers to making content usable by all people with varied abilities (e.g., visual, auditory, cognitive, physical, etc.).
- *Universal Design* ensures broad usability regardless of ability, language, or device, acknowledging intersectional access needs (e.g., internet connectivity, multilingual support).
- *Community-specific needs* are the needs essential to the community that is the intended audience. 
- *Audio Description* is audio that provides a description of visually available information.
- *Captioning* is time-aligned text, typically overlaid on the screen, that describes and interprets information available in the audio stream, including speech as well as other audio information.
- *Transcripts* are text documents that contain correctly sequenced, but not necessarily time-aligned, text descriptions of time-based audio content, including speech as well as other audio information.
- *Alt Text* is a description of an image to be read by assistive technology that conveys the purpose and function of the image.

## Legal and Policy Frameworks
A. Federal Guidelines
- ADA Title II Compliance: Public institutions in the United States must ensure that web content complies with WCAG 2.1 level AA, including media accessibility (captions, transcripts, audio description). For AV content and/or projects hosted by institutions, compliance of local institutional interpretation of ADA / Section 504 / Section 508 / etc. will be important. Different institutions will make different interpretations of how to apply the exceptions.
- Some archival materials may qualify for exceptions, but clear documentation and rationale are required. Individual institutions may have specific local policy interpretation of and/or guidelines around exceptions.
