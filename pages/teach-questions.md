# Guiding Questions for Teachers
- **How will I use the tool as a lens for examining AV primary sources in my course?**
  Do I primarily want students to interact/explore AV primary sources for analysis using the tool? Do I want them to use the tool to produce and overlay new knowledge/insights on the AV primary source?
- **What do I want students to learn from engaging with audiovisual materials?**
  How will I frame student engagement? Projects that include oral histories, archival film, or YouTube or Twitch videos all require different perspectives on access and sharing. Which perspective will best inform my students’ projects?
- **What do I want students to learn from engaging AVAnnotate technology?**
  How do my class learning objectives map onto or diverge from the affordances of digital annotation? Will my conversations include issues around access and privacy or cultural sensitivities? Will students develop tags or will I create them for them? Will I discuss the significance of annotation as a means for discovery with AV? 
- **Do my students have access to technology that will support their use of digital tools and/or AV artifacts?**
  Do students have web access and/or video/audio players?
- **What technical expertise and/or resources will support students’ engagement with AV artifacts or the AVAnnotate tool? 
  Is workshop support, a technical expert, or bespoke documentation for a particular lesson plan or assignment needed? 
- **How will students be assessed based on projects and learning?**
  Are new rubrics, grading schemas, or evaluation criteria needed to assess students’ digital and/or multimodal projects? 
- **What do I need to teach about transparency and consent regarding potentially harmful content?**
  Maybe the annotations themselves could be useful for providing links or references to outside resources that could be useful for students who need context for a problematic or triggering topic. More generally, just beyond problematic and triggering subject matter, use annotations as routes to broader access to related material that may not be the present focus of a set of annotations, but which the students might consider relevant. “Before you explore this topic: explore this ______ in regard to the topic of sexual violence/more sensitive topics”
