# Institutions 
Organizations that have audiovisual materials for possible use with AVAnnotate often include archives, libraries, museums, community collections, etc. Content provided for use in AVAnnotate projects will inherently be ‘annotated’, and those materials may be ‘contextualized’ in new ways by AVAnnotate users. As a result, institutions should consider:

- Copyright and legal constraints with the materials for potential sharing beyond the project itself and within the project. 
- Ethical considerations of how the project author may frame and present the material.
- Digital security - is the material protected from unauthorized copying and reuse.

The institution should determine whether to provide broad access to materials, limited access, or access by permission only.  

Note: while AVAnnotate can be used for internal AVAnnotate use only, the institution should still consider all the above points.
