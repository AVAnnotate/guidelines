# Non-Specialist Public
Non-specialists can benefit from using AVAnnotate in the following ways:
- Interact with audiovisual sources and their contextualization through numerous access points (i.e. tags, annotations, time stamps, and project pages).
- Engage in knowledge production independently or in collaboration with institutions, researchers, and educators.
- If they are the creators of or subjects in the audiovisual, add to the sourceâ€™s contextualization and archival record.

Specific considerations that members of the no-specialist public should consider  include issues of media accessibility (especially regarding institutional permissions and access to AV materials and collections) as well as how sensitive materials are framed and available for use. Ethical, political, and legal implications change depending on where AV sources originate such as from YouTube or the Internet Archive.  

## Guiding Questions
- **Are you represented in this collection?** 
Were you asked to participate in its curation? Is there harmful content? 
- **How are lines of contact created between communities and public collections?**
Do you have a means to communicate with the collecting institution or person? Have resources about community engaged projects, informed consent, qualitative research ethics, etc. been made available? What are some avenues of consent? Who would you contact? 
- **How will the public engage with the project?**  
Are you able to engage with the project? How?
-- **How can you sustain this collection?**
