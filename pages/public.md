# Non-Specialist Public
Non-specialists can benefit from using AVAnnotate in the following ways:
- Interact with audiovisual sources and their contextualization through numerous access points (i.e. tags, annotations, time stamps, and project pages).
- Engage in knowledge production independently or in collaboration with institutions, researchers, and educators.
- If they are the creators of or subjects in the audiovisual, add to the source’s contextualization and archival record.
