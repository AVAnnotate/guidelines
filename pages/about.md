# What is AVAnnotate? 
AVAnnotate is a web-based application that uses free and open-source tools (Jekyll and GitHub Pages) to create static sites on GitHub with playable media, timestamped annotations, index terms, and contextual essays with images, text, and clips. Archivists, librarians, researchers, educators, and students use the AVAnnotate application to present and share context around AV. In addition, AVAnnotate ingests and produces IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) manifests making it interoperable and sustainable according to W3C web-based standards. 
# AVAnnotate Resources
Researchers creating projects with AVAnnotate should read through the AVAnnotate Documentation in order to Get Started, build a Project, construct Collaborations, and view Example Projects. AVAnnotate User Guidelines offer more specific resources for developing access to library collections, course materials, and scholarship.
